Research on microcontrollers. Honestly the nice nano (i.e., a random compatible version on aliexpress) is goated - USB C, built in LiPo charging, a lotta GPIO, and uh probably some other stuff I can't remember rn.

Took a bunch of time but found these, they look good https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005008498887267.html.

Omg ok so aparent JST PH and JST SH and all that is different ;-;.

Luckily this does work - https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005008864177105.html?spm=a2g0o.cart.0.0.2f3538daCbb432.

Had to redo case since PCB JST was moved from bottom to l / r because thats easier to lay down with.

Ok Fusion has a thread feature that saves me -

M12x0.75.

Ok case finished (rip timeline):
